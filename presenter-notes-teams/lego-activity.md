- What is different about building legos that doesnt apply to working professionally? 

## Step 1: The First Build

Time duration: 40 minutes

#### Activity:

- Distribute the instructions among the three teams making sure that each team has a random collection of instructions. This will inculde steps to building an item that is not their assigned build
- Teams must work without verbally talking to other teams

   - Group 1: builds truck
   - Group 2: builds trailer
   - Group 3: builds helicopter

- After the group completes building their assigned sections, show the completed lego to the group. 
- Pictures of the instructions are the only thing you can't share

## Step 2: Post Activity and Planning

Time duration: 30 minutes

#### Questions:

- What resources can be helpful for others building similar components?
- How can you use issues and pull requests to help other teams?
- How can you improve the experience? 
  - Groups each exchange 1 member to the other team

#### Activity:

- Use class repo for creating issues and contributing guidelines for collaborative ways to make building easier.
- In a collective group, come up with ways to improve this process using the class repository and build out the agreed apon solution.
  - Issues
  - Contributing guidelines
  - PRs
  - ...

## Step 3: The Second Build

Time duration: 30 minutes

#### Activity:

### Questions after 2nd Build

- Open discussion about what they experienced on the second build compared to the first. Talking points:

   - Was it difficult without tribal knowledge?
   - Did you find all of you instructions? Which ones were difficult to find? What did you learn while trying to find instructions?
   - Was there an aha moment when things became easier by a large margin, if so, why?
   - What or who was your most valuable resource, why?
   - What do you wish you had? What didn't you need?
   - How could this be a metaphor for your current processes or future processes?
   - What was the most frustrating moment, why?
   - How did communication change between the first round and the second round?
   - Did you gain empathy or understand from working on the same module that another group worked on initially? i.e. maybe their module didn't look great or was incomplete, and you felt it was their fault, but you found it to be more difficult thant you expected
   - Why is it difficult to build something without all of the information?
   - If you were missing some information, how did you know? how did you find it? What was easy or hard about finding that information? 
   - Did the first build help you at all for the second?
