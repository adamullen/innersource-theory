## Why InnerSource can be successful:
![logo](images/Developers.png ':size=100%') **Developers**: Share their work with a wide audience, instead of just with a manager or team. In most open source projects, anyone in the world is free to view the code, comment on it, learn new skills by examining it, and submit changes that they think will improve it or customize it to their needs.

![logo](images/team_discussions.png ':size=100%') **Organizational collaboration**: Communication tends to be written and posted to public sites instead of shared informally by word of mouth, which provides a history of the project as well as learning opportunities for new project members.

![logo](images/ci.png ':size=100%') **Continuous Integration**: Writing unit tests becomes a key programming task. A “unit test” is a small test that checks for a particular, isolated behavior such as rejecting incorrect input or taking the proper branch under certain conditions. In open source and InnerSource, testing is done constantly as changes are checked in to protect against failures during production runs.

## InnerSource means being “Open”
* InnerSource differs from classic open source by remaining within the view and control of a single organization. The “openness” of the project extends across many teams within the organization. This allows the organization to embed differentiating trade secrets into the code without fear that they will be revealed to outsiders, while benefitting from the creativity and diverse perspectives contributed by people throughout the organization.

## InnerSource projects to Open Source

**InnerSource prepares your organization for open source**
* Often, the organization chooses to share parts of an InnerSource project with the public, effectively turning them into open source. When the technologies and management practices of open source are used internally, moving the project into a public arena becomes much easier.

* Because **InnerSource development practices are essentially the most popular open source practices**, open sourcing a project that was developed inside the company is fairly easy. Technically, all the team has to do is move the code to a public repository and start dealing with external bug reports and code contributions the way they have been dealing with such input from other members of their company.

* However, a few legal barriers may stand in the way. If developers incorporated outside code into the project, the legal department must examine all licenses to ensure they have the right to open the code and that their license is compatible with the licenses on the code they incorporated. Some branding review may also be involved.

## Advantages of adopting an InnerSource strategy
1. **Code reuse across the organization grows immensely**. Developers from each team can understand the code and architecture of modules developed by other teams, and contribute code.

2. **Cross-team collaboration becomes relatively frictionless**. Contributed code rarely has to be rewritten by the team receiving it, and no discussions are required at a high management level.

3. **Development becomes faster**. As developers learn to use unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration to remove bugs at an early stage of development. The written comments exchanged among team members, although taking up some time, more than pay for themselves by helping new developers learn the system faster.

4. **Quality documentation is discoverable**. Developers learn to document their code better, both formally (as in-code comments and documentation) and informally (on discussion lists). The documentation provides a history of the project and helps outsiders understand it so that more can contribute to it.

## ⌨️ Activity: Roadblocks
**Purpose**: To list known or potential roadblocks for adopting InnerSource _(Time: ~15 minutes)_

1. Using a whiteboard, collection of sticky notes, or an issue in a repo, discuss and list the following questions as a group.

**Questions**:
- The benefits of InnerSource are great, but what will get in the way of us fully adopting InnerSource?
  - Think about some of the following: team structure, project silos, trust issues, lack of InnerSource vision, etc.
- How would each of your team members answer that question?

?> **Activity Tip** Keep these roadblock items visible. We'll be referring to them throughout the class.
