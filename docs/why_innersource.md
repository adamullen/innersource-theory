# Why InnerSource is so successful:
* Programmers share their work with a wide audience, instead of just with a manager or team. In most open source projects, any‐ one in the world is free to view the code, comment on it, learn new skills by examining it, and submit changes that they think will improve it or customize it to their needs
* New code repositories (branches) based on the project can be made freely, so that sites with unanticipated uses for the code can adapt it. There are usually rules and technical support for remerging different branches into the original master branch
* People at large geographical distances, at separate times, can work on the same code or contribute different files of code to the same project.
* Communication tends to be written and posted to public sites instead of shared informally by word of mouth, which provides 7 a history of the project as well as learning opportunities for new project members
* Writing unit tests becomes a key programming task. A “unit test” is a small test that checks for a particular, isolated behavior such as rejecting incorrect input or taking the proper branch under certain conditions. In open source and InnerSource, test‐ ing is done constantly as changes are checked in, to protect against failures during production runs.

## Why is InnerSource “Open”
* InnerSource differs from classic open source by remaining within the view and control of a single organization. The “openness” of the project extends across many teams within the organization. This allows the organization to embed differentiating trade secrets into the code without fear that they will be revealed to outsiders, while benefitting from the creativity and diverse perspectives contributed by people throughout the organization.
* Often, the organization chooses to share parts of an InnerSource project with the public, effectively turning them into open source. When the technologies and management practices of open source are used internally, moving the project into a public arena becomes much easier.


## Advantages of adopting an InnerSource strategy
* Code reuse across the organization grows immensely. Program‐ mers from each team can understand the code and architecture of modules developed by other teams, and contribute code.
* This cross-team collaboration becomes relatively frictionless. Contributed code rarely has to be rewritten by the team receiv‐ ing it, and no discussions are required at a high management level.
* Development becomes faster as programmers learn to use unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration to remove bugs at an early stage of development. The written comments exchanged among team members, although taking up some time, more than pay for themselves by helping new program‐ mers learn the system faster
* Programmers learn to document their code better, both for‐ mally (as in-code comments and documentation) and infor‐ mally (on discussion lists). The documentation provides a history of the project, and helps outsiders understand it so that more can contribute to it.
