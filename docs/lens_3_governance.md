- The art of providing just the right amount of context and structure, balancing order and chaos.

## GitHub's perspective

- Guide processes, don't mandate them. Give teams freedom to choose the workflow that works for them.
- Reward, and thereby reinforce, the behavior you want, reward can be something as simple as recognition (e.g. :sparkles: sparkle someone)



## Checklist

- [ ] Provide example workflows that teams can use to blueprint their desired workflow
- [ ] Provide a template repository with example README(s), issue and pull request templates, CONTRIBUTING files, license guidance, CODEOWNER templates, gitignore files, etc.
- [ ] Create an `innersource` team within the GitHub organization to provide guidance when at-mentioned
