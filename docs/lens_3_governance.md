## Order vs. chaos

- The art of providing just the right amount of context and structure, balancing order and chaos.

## An open source community behind your firewall

InnerSource does not imply reduced security or privacy. You don’t necessarily have to share proprietary software publicly or invite any outside individuals to view source code or access InnerSource projects. As an organization, you can rest assured that any nonpublic code will remain securely within your environment—and only developers with appropriate permissions will be able to contribute.

## GitHub's perspective

- Guide processes, don't mandate them. Give teams freedom to choose the workflow that works for them.
- Reward, and thereby reinforce, the behavior you want, reward can be something as simple as recognition (e.g. :sparkles: sparkle someone)

## Kickstarter Checklist

- [ ] Provide example workflows that teams can use to blueprint their desired workflow
- [ ] Provide a template repository with example README(s), issue and pull request templates, CONTRIBUTING files, license guidance, CODEOWNER templates, gitignore files, etc.
- [ ] Create an `innersource` team within the GitHub organization to provide guidance when at-mentioned
