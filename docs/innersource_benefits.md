# Why InnerSource can be successful

![logo](images/why-innersource-successful.png ':align=center')

**Developers**: Share their work with a wide audience, instead of just with a manager or team. In most open source projects, anyone in the world is free to view the code, comment on it, learn new skills by examining it, and submit changes that they think will improve it or customize it to their needs.

 **Organizational collaboration**: Communication tends to be written and posted to public sites instead of shared informally by word of mouth, which provides a history of the project as well as learning opportunities for new project members.

 **Continuous Integration**: Writing unit tests becomes a key programming task. A “unit test” is a small test that checks for a particular, isolated behavior such as rejecting incorrect input or taking the proper branch under certain conditions. In open source and InnerSource, testing is done constantly as changes are checked in to protect against failures during production runs.

## InnerSource means being “Open”

- Remains within the view and control of a single organization
- The **“openness”** of the project extends across many teams within the organization
- Allows the organization to embed differentiating trade secrets into the code without fear that they will be revealed to outsiders

!> **Important Discussion Questions**: <br> Is your communication open?<br>How you do fix communication overload?<br>As an organization, do you have a goal to contribute back to the open source community?

## Advantages of adopting an InnerSource strategy

1. **Code reuse across the organization grows immensely**.

2. **Cross-team collaboration becomes relatively frictionless**.

3. **Development becomes faster**.

4. **Quality documentation is discoverable**.

## ⌨️ Activity: What are your reasons?

**Purpose**: To list and better understand cross-team reasons for adopting InnerSource _(Time: ~15 minutes)_

1. Using a whiteboard, collection of sticky notes, or an issue in a repo, discuss and list the potential benefits of InnerSource to your organization.

**Questions**:

- What benefits of InnerSource would be most impactful for our organization?
- What benefits would be most immediate?
- What benefits are most needed?
- How would each of your team members answer these questions?

?> **Activity Tip** Keep these reasons visible. We'll be referring to them throughout the class.
