# How to Succeed in Complex Environments

## Start with strategy

Below are four steps to encourage a unified vision within your organization:

1. Work towards a common goal
2. Motivate and incentivize
3. Collaborate and create
4. Execute and measure

## ⌨️ Activity: Align your organization strategy

**Purpose**: To identify areas of improvement. _(Time: ~20 minutes)_

Below are a few questions for each step to help direct discussions:

> **Four step activity questions**:
> 1. What are some common goals that the organization can work towards?
>   - What are some early success criteria that would promote sharing the progress towards those goals?
> 2. What behaviors do you currently incentivize and motivate employees to do?
>   - How could existing methods be utilized for this initiative?
> 3. What internal projects come to mind when you think of collaboration (Does not need to be developer focused)?
>   - What do you think causes that(those) project(s) to be successful?
>   - What can you use in those projects for this initiative?
> 4. What would you want to measure to identify the success of the initiative?

**Small group discussion: First 10 minutes**
1. In small groups, discuss which of the four steps needs improvement.
2. Which step(s) is the organization doing well at?

**Collective discussion: Second 10 minutes**
3. Share one item that needs improvement and the reasons why.
4. Share one item that the organization is doing well at and the reasons why.
