  - % of issues created from external contributors
  - Responsiveness (e.g. how quickly does someone respond to an issue opened by an external contributor)
  - % of PRs that come from external contributors
  - % of PRs from external teams that are merged
  - % of reviews that come from external contributors
  - % of code reuse across projects
  - % of repositories using InnerSource [components](link to where components are listed in document) to promote collaboration
