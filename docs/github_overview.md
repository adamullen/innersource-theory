!> **Important Discussion Question(s)**: <br><br>Does using GitHub Enterprise mean you are InnerSource?

### Processes, not more tools

GitHub Enterprise gives you feature rich tools for communication, code transparency, team structure, and permissions just to name a few. These features make it easier to collaborate and create a better software development experience, but they don't make you an InnerSource company. If used without structure and with a convoluted alignment of InnerSource practices, GitHub Enterprise alone won't reduce collaboration or integration issues and the bottlenecks within you organization will remain.
