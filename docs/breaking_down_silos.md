### What's wrong with silos?

* **Communication between the silos can become difficult**, and problems can cascade through the company.
* Silos make the world of permissions a devastating mass of unproductively as **people swim upstream to find the tribal knowledge locked away in the silos**.
* **People attempt to diagram the convoluted jungle paths of interactivity and permissions** via road maps. This is a losing battle because the vines continue to grow even as maps are drawn.

## ⌨️ Activity: Structure and behavior limitations
**Purpose**: To collaborate, discuss, and diagram existing team structures. _(Time: ~30 minutes)_

1. Using a whiteboard or sticky notes, collectively collaborate on diagraming the existing organizational team structure, team leads, and managers.

!> **Important Discussion Question(s)**: <br><br>How do you as organization leaders break down silos? <br> Where are the pain points or bottle necks within your organization?

## Transparency Boosts Decision Making
* Transparency improves collaboration, and empowers anyone within the company to see when a project is going off track and help to fix it.

* People need **three things** to participate in decision-making:
  1. **Information** which documentation provides
  2. **Access** which comes in meetings, communication channels
  3. **Permission** which must become part of the InnerSource culture

!> **Important Discussion Question(s)**: <br><br>Which of the three aspects of decision making is your biggest roadblock?

## Removing silos as an organization

It is the responsibility of the leadership team to recognize these silos and rise above to create effective, long-term solutions that are scalable, executable, and realistic.

### How to Succeed in Complex Environments

Organizations that will succeed in adopting an InnerSource mindset have to not only develop and regularly communicate an aligned vision - and the specific narrative to support it - but also answer the questions:

!> **Important Discussion Question(s)**: <br><br>What behaviors and mindsets need to change in order to accomplish this goal? <br>What barriers need to be broken down to accomplish this change effort? <br> How can we build meaningful relationships outside of the silos people exist in?<br>- What benefits are gained from this?

### Change doesn't happen overnight

In most enterprises, it is difficult to make significant changes quickly. Even when it’s possible, rapid cultural or process change can be more disruptive than helpful. This goes double for when the changes are mandated from the top without buy-in from the people in the trenches.

InnerSource works by starting with the smallest steps possible to effect change, and by making meaningful compromises to adapt to circumstances. This minimizes disruption and gives people a chance to see how effective it is before making larger steps. In fact, just a single team in one department can effectively adopt InnerSource, but it won't go too far without the support from the organization and other teams.

## It starts with an organization strategy

Below are four steps to encourage a unified vision within your organization:

1. Work towards a common goal
2. Motivate and incentivize
3. Collaborate and create
4. Execute and measure

## ⌨️ Activity: Align your organization strategy
**Purpose**: To identify areas of improvement. _(Time: ~20 minutes)_

**Small group discussion: First 10 minutes**
1. In small groups, discuss which one of the four steps needs improvement.
2. Which step(s) is the organization doing well at?

**Collective discussion: Second 10 minutes**
3. Share one item that needs improvement and the reasons why.
4. Share one item that the organization is doing well at and the reasons why.
