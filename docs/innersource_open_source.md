# InnerSource & Open Source

**InnerSource prepares your organization for open source**.

## Open-sourcing projects

Often, organizations chooses to share parts of an InnerSource project with the public, effectively turning them into open source.

When the technologies and management practices of open source are used internally, moving the project into a public arena becomes much easier.

## Healthy development practices

Because **InnerSource development practices are essentially the most popular open source practices**, open sourcing a project that was developed inside the company can be fairly easy.

If a project is ready, the team has move the code to a public repository. Then, they start managing external bug reports and code contributions in the same patterns, but with contributors from outside their company.

## Legal considerations

A few legal barriers may stand in the way. If developers incorporated outside code into the project, the legal department must examine all licenses to ensure they have the right to open the code and that their license is compatible with the licenses on the code they incorporated. Some branding review may also be involved.
