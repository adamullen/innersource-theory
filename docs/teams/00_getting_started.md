## What are we going to learn, and why?

> Getting started:
> - Introductions (name, title/specific role in your organization/team)
> - Agenda and high level overview of what to expect
> - Identify a "parking lot" for questions
> - Discuss class logistics (timing of course, recording, etc)
> - After class office hours to support 30, 60, 90 day goals

◀ **Our focus will be on the topics you see listed on the left in the navigation bar.** ◀

## Why is this important to you?

As leaders of your organization, team members will rely on you to **embrace the InnerSource mentality** and to help **enable teams** across the organization to adopt these InnerSource practices.

At the end of this course, you should have a path forward and answers to questions specific to your organization around the **What, Why, and How** of InnerSource. **We will end with a 30, 60, and 90 day checklist** compiled from each lens of InnerSource to help you measure InnerSource success within your organization.

- Do you discover that teams have written code that duplicates functionality written by another team?
- Do you find that teams rewriting code they inherited because they don't understand it, or feel it’s no good, only to encounter issues encountered before?
- Are you aware of code running in production that you wouldn't feel comfortable showing to someone else?
- Are you aware of teams struggling to communicate and collaborate effectively across time, geographic, cultural boundaries?
