## What are we going to learn, and why?

> Getting started:
> - Introductions (name, title/specific role in your organization/team)
> - Agenda and high level overview of what to expect
> - Identify a "parking lot" for questions
> - Discuss class logistics (timing of course, recording, etc)
> - Introduce rollout checklist 

◀ **Our focus will be on the topics you see listed on the left in the navigation bar.** ◀

## Why is this important to you?

InnerSource brings the successful practices of the open source community inside your organization. Practices like increasing transparency, trust, and collaboration are core to InnerSource. These practices aim to reduce the time it takes to bring new ideas to market.

At the end of this course, you should have a path forward and answers to questions specific to your team and organization around the **What, Why, and How** of InnerSource. **We will end with an InnerSource rollout checklist** compiled from each lens of InnerSource to help you measure InnerSource success within your team.

## ⌨️ Activity: Organization pulse
**Purpose**: To gain a high-level pulse of the organization. _(Time: ~10 minutes)_

1. Raise your ✋ hand if you identify with the following question from the provided list below.
2. The instructor will tally each raised hand on each question for a collective pulse.

Raise your hand if you identify with the following:

- Are you overwhelmed by the amount of code there is to maintain within your organization?
- Do you discover that teams have written code that duplicates functionality written by another team?
- Do you find that teams rewriting code they inherited because they don't understand it, or feel it’s no good, only to encounter issues encountered before?
- Are you aware of code running in production that you wouldn't feel comfortable showing to someone else?
- Are you aware of teams struggling to communicate and collaborate effectively across time, geographic, cultural boundaries?
- Are you wanting to contribute to Open Source but finding existing internal processes don’t support this?
- Do you recognize opportunities to increase levels of openness, transparency and participation within your organization?
