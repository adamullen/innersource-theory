# Why InnerSource can be successful

<img src="images/Developers.png" width="100em" align="left"> **Developers**: Share their work with a wide audience, instead of just with a manager or team. In most open source projects, anyone in the world is free to view the code, comment on it, learn new skills by examining it, and submit changes that they think will improve it or customize it to their needs.

<img src="images/team_discussions.png" width="100em" align="right"> **Organizational collaboration**: Communication tends to be written and posted to public sites instead of shared informally by word of mouth, which provides a history of the project as well as learning opportunities for new project members.

<img src="images/ci.png" width="100em" align="left"> **Continuous Integration**: Writing unit tests becomes a key programming task. A “unit test” is a small test that checks for a particular, isolated behavior such as rejecting incorrect input or taking the proper branch under certain conditions. In open source and InnerSource, testing is done constantly as changes are checked in to protect against failures during production runs.

## InnerSource means being “Open”

InnerSource differs from classic open source by remaining within the view and control of a single organization. The “openness” of the project extends across many teams within the organization. This allows the organization to embed differentiating trade secrets into the code without fear that they will be revealed to outsiders, while benefitting from the creativity and diverse perspectives contributed by people throughout the organization.

## Advantages of adopting an InnerSource strategy

1. **Code reuse across the organization grows immensely**. Developers from each team can understand the code and architecture of modules developed by other teams, and contribute code.

2. **Cross-team collaboration becomes relatively frictionless**. Contributed code rarely has to be rewritten by the team receiving it, and no discussions are required at a high management level.

3. **Development becomes faster**. As developers learn to use unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration to remove bugs at an early stage of development. The written comments exchanged among team members, although taking up some time, more than pay for themselves by helping new developers learn the system faster.

4. **Quality documentation is discoverable**. Developers learn to document their code better, both formally (as in-code comments and documentation) and informally (on discussion lists). The documentation provides a history of the project and helps outsiders understand it so that more can contribute to it.

## ⌨️ Activity: What are your reasons?

**Purpose**: To list and better understand cross-team reasons for adopting InnerSource _(Time: ~15 minutes)_

1. Using a whiteboard, collection of sticky notes, or an issue in a repo, discuss and list the potential benefits of InnerSource to your organization.

**Questions**:

- What benefits of InnerSource would be most impactful for our organization?
- What benefits would be most immediate?
- What benefits are most needed?
- How would each of your team members answer these questions?

?> **Activity Tip** Keep these reasons visible. We'll be referring to them throughout the class.
