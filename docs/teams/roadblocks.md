# Roadblocks to Progress

## ⌨️ Activity: Roadblocks

**Purpose**: To list known or potential roadblocks for adopting InnerSource _(Time: ~15 minutes)_

1. Using a whiteboard, collection of sticky notes, or an issue in a repo, discuss and list the following questions as a group.

**Questions**:

- The benefits of InnerSource are great, but what will get in the way of us fully adopting InnerSource?
  - Think about some of the following: team structure, project silos, trust issues, lack of InnerSource vision, etc.
- How would each of your team members answer that question?

?> **Activity Tip** Keep these roadblock items visible. We'll be referring to them throughout the class.
