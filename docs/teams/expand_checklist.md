An integral part of adopting InnerSource within your team is establishing goals, milestones, and then creating a checklist of items that need to be accomplished within your team to meet those goals.

## Expanding your checklist

Many companies have already adopted InnerSource or are currently in the process. There is a lot of great information from many resources including [InnerSource Commons](https://innersourcecommons.org/) and [PayPal's journey](https://innersourcecommons.org/assets/files/InnerSourceChecklist.pdf) just to name a few.

Below is an expanded checklist compiled from many resources including PayPal, GNU Manifesto, and the Apache Way.
