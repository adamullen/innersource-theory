## Making Repos Better

Based on yesterday's content and the lego exercise, lets start applying that knowledge to a repository template that can be shared within the team and throughout the organization:

#### Some example team projects could be:

- Responsible for a dependency used by multiple projects
- Standalone project with little dependency on other projects
- Internal tool repository
- Project that might be open sourced in the future

## ⌨️ Activity: Building and creating assets for your project

**Time**: _(~3 hours)_

As a collective group, discuss and build the "ideal" repository with framework files that are specific to the repository.

- What does the repo or repos look like?
- How is the team defined?
- What does the overall organization look like for your group or groups?

If someone new to your team's project wanted to contribute for the first time, how painless would their process be?

Does your project need the following? If it already exists, how can you improve it?

- [ ] README
- [ ] Issue and PR templates
- [ ] Contributing guides
- [ ] .gitignore
- [ ] Do you specify the TC role?
- [ ] CODEOWNER
- [ ] License agreements
- [ ] Tagging conventions
- [ ] Branch naming conventions
- [ ] Workflow guidance
