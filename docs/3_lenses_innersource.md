## Let's look at InnerSource with different lenses

![logo](images/3-lenses.png)


Now that we've discussed **why** InnerSource benefits an organization, it's time to discuss **how** InnerSource can be adopted. When tackling this question, we've found that it helps to look at your organization with three different lenses.

## Culture

Our first lens is **culture**. Think of this as a view from 35,000 feet. An overall big picture of your organization.
- How does it look? Is it a convoluted mess, and organized masterpiece, or somewhere in between?
- If someone outside of your organization had this view, what would they think?
- How receptive is your organization, culturally, to an InnerSource way of working?

## Developer enablement

Our second lens is **developer enablement**. This is the view from the ground, the first-person point of view on how things look in your organization.
- How does if look from this perspective?
- What tools and tactics are available that enable and empower your developers as they grow accustomed to an InnerSource way of working within your organization?
- If you were to ask a random set of developers within your organization how enabled they feel to work with other teams, what do you think they would say?

## Governance

Our third view is **governance**. Think of this as ***air traffic control*** that governs the aircrafts in the sky and the personal on the ground. This is the leadership team within the organization.
- Are there ensuring guiding principles, roles, and processes in place to foster an InnerSource environment?
- Does the developer community within your organization get the support it needs?
